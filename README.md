## What it does
This script runs in several steps:
1. It accesses the results of a query run on data.world. It expects that the query will return a single column called "searchUrl" and within that column is a single URL per row. The query results are downloaded and stored in local memory.
2. Using Microsoft Playwright, it then opens a chromium browser window, navigates to the first URL in the list, searches the contents for `a` links that contain either certain strings (e.g., `pric`, `bill`, `cms` etc.) in the displayed text or the href value, or contain particular file extensions (e.g., `xls`, `csv`, `json` etc.) The strings can be updated by changing  `words` in `index.js` and the file extensions can be changed by updating `fileTypes` in `index.js`
3. When links are found, the browser navigates to each of the links, once again looking for `a` links that contain certain strings or file extensions. When files are found, the search ends, and a new page is opened and navigates to the next hospital URL on the list.
**Note** To keep this from running endlessly all over the internet, it will force stop searching URLs after it has searched a specific number for a given hospital. Change this number by updating `MAX_TO_CHECK` in `index.js`
4. When links have been found, the URL for each link, the URL that the links were found on, and the original URL used to find the hospital are formatted as a JSON object, and written to a local file (`links.json`) using a `writeStream`. Similarly, if links haven't been found after the `MAX_TO_CHECK` number of URLs has been searched, the original URL and a "best guess" of where the files may be are written to a local file (`missingLinks.json`) using a `writeStream`.
5. After a certain number of hospitals have been checked, the files are automatically added to a [data.world dataset](https://data.world/ushealthcarepricing/location-of-standard-charge-files). To change how often this happens, update the `BACKUP` variable in `index.js`.

## What you need
This script expects that you have data.world API credentials saved in a `.env` file at the base of your project directory. You'll find more information about data.world API credentials [here](https://docs.data.world/en/64499-65048-10--Finding-your-API-tokens-for-data-world.html).
